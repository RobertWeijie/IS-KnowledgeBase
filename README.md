# ***学姐：对准大一新生的小小建议
1. 要尽早对未来有个打算 （譬如说要考研、或者直接就业这些方面早早打算后面才更有底气）
2. 尽量不要熬夜
3. 多跟本地人中国学生打交道（难得出国一趟，不打开自己的社交圈子真的很可惜）
4. 找到属于自己的圈子（在一个完全不熟悉的环境当中难免会觉得孤独，这时候这个圈子就是你的）
5. 要学会独立
6.不要听从任何建议，有些别人说的建议其实未免会适合与你，只要不违背道德原则，做自己不后悔的事情，你的大学生活就不会留下任何遗憾。



在开学前每一届的学生都会有一个大群，无论是留学生也好还是本地生都会有这样的群，关键是如何进群。 可以在QQ那边寻找，只要输入关键词即可（比如：22年xx大学之类的相关词汇）

多关注与学校相关的公众号，那里有很多可用的资讯，比如项目、实习、论坛、学长学姐的经验分享等之类可以让你得到更多机会的地方。 还有每一所学校都有的树洞，只要输入关键词，你就能够找到这些信息（比如：实习、项目、之类的）。


**Suggestions for freshmen**
1. Make a plan for the future as early as possible (for example, to take the postgraduate entrance examination, or to directly obtain employment, so that you will be more confident if you plan early)
2. Try not to stay up late
3. Deal more with locals and Chinese students (it’s a pity not to open up your social circle if you rarely go abroad)
4. Find your own circle (you will inevitably feel lonely in a completely unfamiliar environment, and this circle is yours at this time)
5. Learn to be independent
6. Don't follow any advice. Some advice given by others may actually be suitable for you. As long as you don't violate the moral principles and do things you don't regret, your college life will not leave any regrets.



Before the start of school, there will be a large group of students in each class, whether it is an international student or a local student, there will be such a group, the key is how to enter the group. You can find it on QQ, just enter keywords (for example: related words such as xx university in 22 years)

Pay more attention to the public accounts related to the school, there are a lot of information available, such as projects, internships, forums, experience sharing by seniors and sisters, etc., where you can get more opportunities. There are also tree holes in every school, as long as you enter keywords, you can find this information (for example: internships, projects, etc.).
