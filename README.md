## **关于我/About Me** 🇵🇦

## 为什么会有这个想法？Why i have this idea?😂

其实一开始有这个想法是想着打破来华留学生在中国留学的信息差，是否我们在选择“专业”的时候是否知道课程的难度？ 具体大学生活？ 在中国生活等等，然后觉得人生始终要做一些有意义的事情吧，所以就有了这个想法。


In fact, I had this idea at the beginning to break the information gap for international students studying in China. Do we know the difficulty of the course when we choose a "major"? Specifically university life? After living in China and so on, I felt that I should always do something meaningful in life, so I came up with this idea.


## 具体的库是怎么操作呢？How does the specific library operate?  😊


我将会在每个分支不同大学的名称方便同学们去搜索，去获取自己想要的信息，希望一切的一切都能帮到大家


I will make it easier for students to search for the names of different universities in each branch and obtain the information they want. I hope everything can help you.


## **md.文件** ⭐
每个分支都有自己专属的.md 文件，这些文件都是在校生的可以是一些感言，或者大学的生活日常等等一切


Each branch has its own exclusive .md file. These files are all students in school, which can be some testimonials, or the daily life of the university, etc.

## **怎么下载里面的文件和具体怎么操作？How to download the files inside and how to operate?** ✈️
* 对于一些比较懂技术的同学可以clone 仓库项目到你的本地仓库也可以下载此仓库项目（指的是zip文件）

   首先点击你想要看的分支然后点击Code 显示Download Zip点击即可下载到你的电脑

*  如果仓库文件过多和过大下载速度过慢怎么办？
  
   在此我们可以在浏览器Chrome 插件商城搜索**Github加速**，下载安装后，刷新页面，此时就能看到**Download Zip** 有不同的国家线路下载此时会加速你的下载速度，如果不想下载整个仓库项目也可以单下载“**文件**” 直接点击相关文件按Download 即可

* For some students who are more technically savvy, you can clone the warehouse project to your local warehouse or download this warehouse project (referring to the zip file)
  
  First click on the branch you want to see and then click Code to display Download Zip and click to download to your computer


* What should I do if there are too many warehouse files and the download speed is too slow?
  
    Here we can search for Github acceleration in the browser Chrome plug-in store. After downloading and installing, refresh the page. At this time, you can see that Download Zip has different country lines to download. This will speed up your download speed. If you don’t want to download the entire warehouse project You can also download the "file" directly, click on the relevant file and press Download
