来华留学生共享库
具体可以看每个分支 对应不同的学校


Shared Library for International Students in China, You can refer to each branch for details, corresponding to different schools


**为什么会有这个想法？😂**

其实一开始有这个想法是想着打破来华留学生在中国留学的信息差，是否我们在选择“专业”的时候是否知道课程的难度？ 具体大学生活？ 在中国生活等等，然后觉得人生始终要做一些有意义的事情吧，所以就有了这个想法。

**Why do you have this idea?**

In fact, I had this idea at the beginning to break the information gap for international students studying in China. Do we know the difficulty of the course when we choose a "major"? Specifically university life? After living in China and so on, I felt that I should always do something meaningful in life, so I came up with this idea.


**具体的库是怎么操作呢？**


我将会在每个分支不同大学的名称方便同学们去搜索，去获取自己想要的信息，希望一切的一切都能帮到大家

**How does the specific library operate?**


I will make it easier for students to search for the names of different universities in each branch and obtain the information they want. I hope everything can help you.
